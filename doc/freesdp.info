Introduction
************

FreeSDP is a C library that provides a complete set of functions to
fetch the information multimedia session descriptions in SDP format
enclose. It can also format FreeSDP descriptions from the necessary
session parameters. Its purpose is to allow for fully parsing and
formatting of SDP descriptions while abstracting the concrete syntax of
SDP.

   FreeSDP is free software. Everyone can use and redistribute it on a
free basis. Note that from a legal point of view free software has
nothing to do with public domain. Also note that from a philosophical
point of view free software has nothing to do with open source
software. Though free software and open software communities often
cooperate their goals deeply differ. For a better discussion of this
issues you may look at `http://www.fsf.org/philosophy/philosophy.html'
and the `http://www.fsf.org' site as a whole. FreeSDP is licensed under
the GNU General Public License *Note GNU General Public License::.

   The Session Description Protocol SDP has been developed within and
is in widespread use in the Mbone, the multicast backbone of the
Internet, where multimedia session announcements are publicized through
the use of the web, e-mail and the Session Announcement Protocol (SAP,
`RFC 2974'). In addition, it is currently the primary means for session
description in the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP, `RFC 3261') and
the Real Time Streaming Protocol (RTSP, `RFC 2326').

   The SDP protocol is developed by the MMUSIC (Multiparty Multimedia
Session Control) working group of the Internet Engineering Task Force
(`http://www.ietf.org'), IETF henceforth.  See
(`http://www.ietf.org/html.charters/mmusic-charter.html') for info on
the MMUSIC working group.

   The first standard definition of SDP, RFC 2327, states that:

     SDP is intended for describing multimedia sessions for the
     purposes of session announcement, session invitation, and other
     forms of multimedia session initiation.

   This document describes FreeSDP and assumes a certain level of
familiarity with multimedia sessions in Internet. The reader new to
this field should have a look at the aforementioned references before
starting to use FreeSDP. The first sections of the RFC 2327 provide a
good introduction to multimedia session description.

   Note that this document is not a reference manual for FreeSDP. The
reference manual is automatically generated from source files through
Doxygen (see <http://www.doxygen.org>) under the doc/refman directory
in the source distribution.

   In section *Note FreeSDP Overview::, a brief description of the
library is provided. Its level of conformance with the IETF standards
is discussed in *Note Standards Tracking::.

   In *Note Using FreeSDP::, how to program with FreeSDP is explained.
This section introduces the two modules of FreeSDP: the parser and the
formatter, which are further explained in sections *Note Parsing:: and
*Note Formatting::, respectively. *Note FreeSDP Internals:: outlines how
FreeSDP does its work and how to hack it.

   Finally, *Note Other Related Works:: provides information on
resources that may be of interest for people working with SDP and
multimedia conferences, and *Note Future Work:: outlines how SDP and
FreeSDP are expected to evolve.

FreeSDP Overview
****************

FreeSDP provides a complete set of entry points to parse and format
FreeSDP descriptions. It aims to be minimal, secure and fast, as well
as supporting multi-thread programming.

   FreeSDP manages SDP descriptions through objects of the type
`fsdp_description_t'. These objects are dynamically built and destroyed
using `fsdp_description_new' and `fsdp_description_delete',
respectively.

   There are two modules in FreeSDP: the parsing module and the
formatting module. The former consists of the structures and routines
needed to get the information enclosed in SDP descriptions; the latter
consists of the structures and routines that format SDP descriptions
from the parameters provided to the library. These are documented
separately in the FreeSDP reference manual. FreeSDP works parsing SDP
descriptions from and formatting to memory buffers.

   In the parsing module, the routine `fsdp_parse' is a constructor
that builds a description object from a textual SDP description located
at a memory buffer. Most of the other routines in the parsing module
(named `fsdp_get_xxxx') provide access to the information the
description object has been filled with (they are access methods of the
description object). So a typical program based on FreeSDP parses any
session description once and first, and then, asks about the session
properties.

   Conversely, in the formatting module, `fsdp_format' formats (or
prints) multimedia session descriptions into memory buffers. Before
calling `fsdp_format' a description object must be filled with the
information to be formatted. The process starts with a call to
`fsdp_make_description' which initializes an object description (it is
a constructor that builds a description object from the necessary
session parameters).

   So a typical program that uses FreeSDP usually calls
`fsdp_make_description' first and then calls several routines (named
`fsdp_set_xxxx' and `fsdp_add_xxxx') to fill a description object with
data describing a multimedia session (they are methods that modify the
description object). When every parameter has been set, the application
finally calls `fsdp_format' in order to format the whole description in
SDP into a memory buffer. Note however that, since the routine
`fsdp_make_description' takes as arguments all the necessary parameters
to build a complete and standard compliant SDP description, a call to
`fsdp_make_description' followed by a call to `fsdp_format' formats a
minimal standard SDP description.

Standards Tracking
******************

     *Warning:* This chapter is yet uncomplete and subject to quick
     changes.

   Since SDP was designed when many of the applications it is used
today for were not clearly defined yet, several extensions to SDP have
been proposed in the IETF. This chapter specifies which of these
extensions FreeSDP implements, as well as what RFC's FreeSDP complies
with.

   The primary means for extending FreeSDP are attributes, and they can
be registered with IANA, see the `Session Description Protocol (SDP)
Parameters' list at IANA
(<http://www.iana.org/assignments/sdp-parameters>).

   What follows is a list of SDP related RFCs, Internet Drafts and other
documents, with notes on the conformance degree currently provided by
FreeSDP:

   * `SDP: Session Description Protocol (RFC 2327)'.

   * `Session Description Protocol Bandwidth Modifiers for RTP Control
     Protocol Bandwidth (RFC 3556)'. RS and RR bandwidth modifiers to
     specify RTCP bandwith reserved for senders and receivers,
     respectively.

   * `SDP: Session Description Protocol (draft-ietf-mmusic-sdp-new)'.

   * `RTCP Atribute in SDP (RFC 3606)', definition of the `rtcp'
     attribute.

   * `Conventions for the use of the Session Description Protocol (SDP)
     for ATM Bearer Connections (RFC 3108)'.

   * `Support for IPv6 in SDP (RFC 3266)'

   * `RTP payload format and file storage format for the Adaptive
     Multi-Rate(AMR) and Adaptive Multi-Rate Wideband (AMR-WB) audio
     codecs (RFC 3267)'

   * `SDP Simple Capability Declaration (RFC 3307)'

   * `Integration of Resource Management and SIP (RFC 3312)'

   * `Grouping of media lines in SDP (RFC 3388)'

   * `SDP Simple Capability Declaration (RFC 3435)'

   * `ITU-T Rec. T.38 Annex D'

   * `RFC 3066' and `RFC 3282'. Language list specification relevant

Using FreeSDP
*************

The FreeSDP programming interface is made up of functions that
manipulate multimedia session description objects. The interface is
designed so that parsing and formatting of descriptions can be
performed independently. In fact, applications can only use whether the
parsing functionalities or the formatting functionalities.

   If your application only needs to parse SDP descriptions (it does
not build them), you can just do `#include <freesdp/parser.h>' and link
your application with the library `freesdpp'.

   On the contrary, if you are going to use the formatting module only,
you can just do `#include <freesdp/formatter.h>' and link with the
library `freesdpf'.

   If you are interested in both modules, you can just do `include
<freesdp/freesdp.h>' and link with the library `freesdp', which
includes both the parsing and the formatting modules.

       --------------         ---------------
       |  parser.h  |         | formatter.h |
       --------------         ---------------
             ^                       ^
             |-----------------------|
                         |
                      -----------
                      |freesdp.h|
                      -----------

   FreeSDP is a C library but it is ready to be directly used in C++
programs (name mangling is switched off for the symbols exported from
FreeSDP).

   The source distribution of FreeSDP includes, under the demo
directory, two files called parsedemo.c and formatdemo, which
illustrate the use of the parsing and formattin modules, respectively.

   The type used in FreeSDP to represent SDP descriptions is
fsdp_description_t.

   The type that represents in SDP media announcements.

   The `fsdp_error_t' type. Error codes.

   Network and transport protocols related types: `fsdp_network_type_t'

   `fsdp_address_type_t'

   `fsdp_transport_protocol_t'

   Time related types.  `fsdp_repeat_t'

   `fsdp_time_period_t'

   `fsdp_media_t'. Media (audio, video, etc.)

   Miscellaneuous attributes types

   `fsdp_bw_modifier_type_t'

   `fsdp_encryption_method_t'

   `fsdp_sendrecv_mode_t'

   `fsdp_orient_t'

   `fsdp_sessio_type_t'

   `fsdp_session_str_att_t'

   `fsdp_media_str_att_t'

   An SDP session description consists of a session-level section and
zero or more media-level sections.

   Each SDP multimedia session description includes:
   - Session name and purpose.

   - List of time periods the session is active.

   - Contact information for the responsible for the session (session
     owner).

   - Media used in the session.

   - Network, transport and application level parameters for the
     session: network addresses, transport ports, media formats, etc.

   - Information about the session bandwidth.

Parsing
*******

The following code parses an SDP description:

     #include <freesdp/parser.h>
     
     int
     main ( char argc, char *argv[] )
     {
             fsdp_description_t dsc;
     
             fsdp_parse(...);
     }

   _TODO_: Error codes:

   there are several error codes in the form of `FSDPE_XXXX_MISSING',
such as `FSDPE_VERSION_MISSING' and `FSDPE_OWNER_MISSING'. These
indicate that a determined line is does not appear where, accroding to
the SDP specification, it must be. For instance, if an SDP description
lacks the first `v=0' line, `FSDPE_VERSION_MISSING' will be returned by
fsdp_parse. (Note that the `v=0' line could be afterwards, but it would
be illegal according to the SDP syntax.)

   A special case of `INVALID' error is `FSDPE_NAME_EMPTY'.

Formatting
**********

Once a media announcement object is incorporated into a session
announcement object, see the fsdp_add_media function, the media object
must not be destroyed as long as the session object exists. Media
objects can be incorporated into more than one session at the same time.

 - Function: fsdp_make_description *dsc sdp_version *session_name
          *session_id *announcement_version *owner_username *owner_nt
          *owner_at *owner_address start stop
     `fsdp_make_description' builds an object with the minimun required
     information. The resulting object is ready to format an SDP
     description throuth a call to `fsdp_format'.

 - Function: fsdp_format *dsc **text_description
     `fsdp_format' formats the description in dsc into description

 - Function: fsdp_format_bounded *dsc **text_description maxsize
     `fsdp_format_bounded' is a lower level routine. It limits the size
     of the resulting text to MAXSIZE.

 - Function: fsdp_make_media **mdsc type *port tp *formats
     Allocates a new media announcements `fsdp_media_announcement_t'

 - Function: fsdp_add_media *dsc *mdsc
     Incorporate a media announcement into a session announcement.

FreeSDP Internals
*****************

TODO: characters set ISO-10646 in UTF-8 encoding. (Something should be
said about this on the introductio).

   _TODO:_ Short paragraph on sources arrangement.

   _TODO:_ - Private headers: `priv.h' -global private header,
`parserpriv.h' -private header for the parser module, `formatterpriv.h'
-private header for the formatter module.

   There are a few simple design principles that can be seen taking a
look at the code. These principles have been applied since FreeSDP aims
to be a base library for systems in which the SDP protocol is used:

   * Minimality. FreeSDP is designed to be a small library with a
     compact set of entry points.

   * Security. Security issues such us buffer overflows or malicious
     syntax errors are checked for in an uniform manner thoughout the
     library.

   * Speed. Without sacrificing security, and being an small library,
     FreeSDP routines and data structures are designed to be fast and
     allow for optimizations without precluding multi-threaded
     programming.

   * For the sake of minimality, fsdp_description_clone, ...  are not
     defined. If they become necessary at any time, I will add them
     inmediately. For now, they do not seem to be very useful.


   Speed: if calls to fsdp_parse_c, fsdp_parse_o, fsdp_parse_k were
coded inline in fsdp_parse, this function would take more than 500
lines, with code duplicated exactly the same for session-level lines and
media-level lines. Since the same rules apply (with few exceptions) to
both session-level and media-level lines...

   Where there is no risk of code duplication, inlining code in
`fsdp_parse' has been preferred, as can be seen in the case of o=
lines, at the beginning of `fsdp_parse'.

   Where functionality is not the same for session-level as for
media-level, as is the case with attributes (there are specific
session-level attributes and specific media-level attributes)...

   Source distribution `src/' directory `parser.c'

   FreeSDP is documented with Doxygen. (special comments)

 - Function: fsdp_parse (fasd fdf *f, fdf pp)
     First, session-level description lines are parsed. Then,
     media-level description lines are parsed.


   network types are treated as strings URIs: times (SDP sessions may
be permanent, bounded or unbounded) encryption keys

   TODO: Parsing SDP multimedia session descriptions

   TODO: Time intervals

   The ABNF syntax is given in RFC 2327

 - Macro: NEXT_LINE c
     advance char pointer `c' up to the first character after the first
     new line.

   Adding new attributes: first, check if it is session-level,
media-level or both.

Future Work
***********

Obviously, the evolution of FreeSDP is tightly tied to the evolution of
the SDP protocol. The FreeSDP core is not expected to change or grow a
lot. Since the design of FreeSDP takes into account all the global
features and requirements of SDP, only minor additions (such as new
attributes or new bandwidth modifiers) should be necessary to bring up
to date FreeSDP as new standards or standard revisions arise.

   On the other hand, the features already present in version 0 of SDP
are not likely to disappear or change deeply, as it can be seen
comparing the first official specification of SDP `RFC 2327' with the
newest, as of this writing, `draft-ietf-mmusic-sdp-new'.

   This leaves us two fields in which to work to improve FreeSDP:

   * Add new description fields and/or field values defined in new
     standards,

   * Improve FreeSDP in terms of robustness, efficiency and security.

     Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
     of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

  0. PREAMBLE

     The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other
     functional and useful document "free" in the sense of freedom: to
     assure everyone the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it,
     with or without modifying it, either commercially or
     noncommercially.  Secondarily, this License preserves for the
     author and publisher a way to get credit for their work, while not
     being considered responsible for modifications made by others.

     This License is a kind of "copyleft", which means that derivative
     works of the document must themselves be free in the same sense.
     It complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft
     license designed for free software.

     We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for
     free software, because free software needs free documentation: a
     free program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms
     that the software does.  But this License is not limited to
     software manuals; it can be used for any textual work, regardless
     of subject matter or whether it is published as a printed book.
     We recommend this License principally for works whose purpose is
     instruction or reference.

  1. APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS

     This License applies to any manual or other work, in any medium,
     that contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it
     can be distributed under the terms of this License.  Such a notice
     grants a world-wide, royalty-free license, unlimited in duration,
     to use that work under the conditions stated herein.  The
     "Document", below, refers to any such manual or work.  Any member
     of the public is a licensee, and is addressed as "you".  You
     accept the license if you copy, modify or distribute the work in a
     way requiring permission under copyright law.

     A "Modified Version" of the Document means any work containing the
     Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with
     modifications and/or translated into another language.

     A "Secondary Section" is a named appendix or a front-matter section
     of the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the
     publishers or authors of the Document to the Document's overall
     subject (or to related matters) and contains nothing that could
     fall directly within that overall subject.  (Thus, if the Document
     is in part a textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not
     explain any mathematics.)  The relationship could be a matter of
     historical connection with the subject or with related matters, or
     of legal, commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position
     regarding them.

     The "Invariant Sections" are certain Secondary Sections whose
     titles are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in
     the notice that says that the Document is released under this
     License.  If a section does not fit the above definition of
     Secondary then it is not allowed to be designated as Invariant.
     The Document may contain zero Invariant Sections.  If the Document
     does not identify any Invariant Sections then there are none.

     The "Cover Texts" are certain short passages of text that are
     listed, as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice
     that says that the Document is released under this License.  A
     Front-Cover Text may be at most 5 words, and a Back-Cover Text may
     be at most 25 words.

     A "Transparent" copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy,
     represented in a format whose specification is available to the
     general public, that is suitable for revising the document
     straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images
     composed of pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some
     widely available drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to
     text formatters or for automatic translation to a variety of
     formats suitable for input to text formatters.  A copy made in an
     otherwise Transparent file format whose markup, or absence of
     markup, has been arranged to thwart or discourage subsequent
     modification by readers is not Transparent.  An image format is
     not Transparent if used for any substantial amount of text.  A
     copy that is not "Transparent" is called "Opaque".

     Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain
     ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format,
     SGML or XML using a publicly available DTD, and
     standard-conforming simple HTML, PostScript or PDF designed for
     human modification.  Examples of transparent image formats include
     PNG, XCF and JPG.  Opaque formats include proprietary formats that
     can be read and edited only by proprietary word processors, SGML or
     XML for which the DTD and/or processing tools are not generally
     available, and the machine-generated HTML, PostScript or PDF
     produced by some word processors for output purposes only.

     The "Title Page" means, for a printed book, the title page itself,
     plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the
     material this License requires to appear in the title page.  For
     works in formats which do not have any title page as such, "Title
     Page" means the text near the most prominent appearance of the
     work's title, preceding the beginning of the body of the text.

     A section "Entitled XYZ" means a named subunit of the Document
     whose title either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses
     following text that translates XYZ in another language.  (Here XYZ
     stands for a specific section name mentioned below, such as
     "Acknowledgements", "Dedications", "Endorsements", or "History".)
     To "Preserve the Title" of such a section when you modify the
     Document means that it remains a section "Entitled XYZ" according
     to this definition.

     The Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice
     which states that this License applies to the Document.  These
     Warranty Disclaimers are considered to be included by reference in
     this License, but only as regards disclaiming warranties: any other
     implication that these Warranty Disclaimers may have is void and
     has no effect on the meaning of this License.

  2. VERBATIM COPYING

     You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either
     commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the
     copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License
     applies to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you
     add no other conditions whatsoever to those of this License.  You
     may not use technical measures to obstruct or control the reading
     or further copying of the copies you make or distribute.  However,
     you may accept compensation in exchange for copies.  If you
     distribute a large enough number of copies you must also follow
     the conditions in section 3.

     You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above,
     and you may publicly display copies.

  3. COPYING IN QUANTITY

     If you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly
     have printed covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100, and
     the Document's license notice requires Cover Texts, you must
     enclose the copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all
     these Cover Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and
     Back-Cover Texts on the back cover.  Both covers must also clearly
     and legibly identify you as the publisher of these copies.  The
     front cover must present the full title with all words of the
     title equally prominent and visible.  You may add other material
     on the covers in addition.  Copying with changes limited to the
     covers, as long as they preserve the title of the Document and
     satisfy these conditions, can be treated as verbatim copying in
     other respects.

     If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit
     legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit
     reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto
     adjacent pages.

     If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document
     numbering more than 100, you must either include a
     machine-readable Transparent copy along with each Opaque copy, or
     state in or with each Opaque copy a computer-network location from
     which the general network-using public has access to download
     using public-standard network protocols a complete Transparent
     copy of the Document, free of added material.  If you use the
     latter option, you must take reasonably prudent steps, when you
     begin distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure that
     this Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated
     location until at least one year after the last time you
     distribute an Opaque copy (directly or through your agents or
     retailers) of that edition to the public.

     It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of
     the Document well before redistributing any large number of
     copies, to give them a chance to provide you with an updated
     version of the Document.

  4. MODIFICATIONS

     You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document
     under the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you
     release the Modified Version under precisely this License, with
     the Modified Version filling the role of the Document, thus
     licensing distribution and modification of the Modified Version to
     whoever possesses a copy of it.  In addition, you must do these
     things in the Modified Version:

       A. Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title
          distinct from that of the Document, and from those of
          previous versions (which should, if there were any, be listed
          in the History section of the Document).  You may use the
          same title as a previous version if the original publisher of
          that version gives permission.

       B. List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or
          entities responsible for authorship of the modifications in
          the Modified Version, together with at least five of the
          principal authors of the Document (all of its principal
          authors, if it has fewer than five), unless they release you
          from this requirement.

       C. State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the
          Modified Version, as the publisher.

       D. Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.

       E. Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications
          adjacent to the other copyright notices.

       F. Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license
          notice giving the public permission to use the Modified
          Version under the terms of this License, in the form shown in
          the Addendum below.

       G. Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant
          Sections and required Cover Texts given in the Document's
          license notice.

       H. Include an unaltered copy of this License.

       I. Preserve the section Entitled "History", Preserve its Title,
          and add to it an item stating at least the title, year, new
          authors, and publisher of the Modified Version as given on
          the Title Page.  If there is no section Entitled "History" in
          the Document, create one stating the title, year, authors,
          and publisher of the Document as given on its Title Page,
          then add an item describing the Modified Version as stated in
          the previous sentence.

       J. Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document
          for public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and
          likewise the network locations given in the Document for
          previous versions it was based on.  These may be placed in
          the "History" section.  You may omit a network location for a
          work that was published at least four years before the
          Document itself, or if the original publisher of the version
          it refers to gives permission.

       K. For any section Entitled "Acknowledgements" or "Dedications",
          Preserve the Title of the section, and preserve in the
          section all the substance and tone of each of the contributor
          acknowledgements and/or dedications given therein.

       L. Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document,
          unaltered in their text and in their titles.  Section numbers
          or the equivalent are not considered part of the section
          titles.

       M. Delete any section Entitled "Endorsements".  Such a section
          may not be included in the Modified Version.

       N. Do not retitle any existing section to be Entitled
          "Endorsements" or to conflict in title with any Invariant
          Section.

       O. Preserve any Warranty Disclaimers.

     If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or
     appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no
     material copied from the Document, you may at your option
     designate some or all of these sections as invariant.  To do this,
     add their titles to the list of Invariant Sections in the Modified
     Version's license notice.  These titles must be distinct from any
     other section titles.

     You may add a section Entitled "Endorsements", provided it contains
     nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various
     parties--for example, statements of peer review or that the text
     has been approved by an organization as the authoritative
     definition of a standard.

     You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text,
     and a passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end
     of the list of Cover Texts in the Modified Version.  Only one
     passage of Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be
     added by (or through arrangements made by) any one entity.  If the
     Document already includes a cover text for the same cover,
     previously added by you or by arrangement made by the same entity
     you are acting on behalf of, you may not add another; but you may
     replace the old one, on explicit permission from the previous
     publisher that added the old one.

     The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this
     License give permission to use their names for publicity for or to
     assert or imply endorsement of any Modified Version.

  5. COMBINING DOCUMENTS

     You may combine the Document with other documents released under
     this License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for
     modified versions, provided that you include in the combination
     all of the Invariant Sections of all of the original documents,
     unmodified, and list them all as Invariant Sections of your
     combined work in its license notice, and that you preserve all
     their Warranty Disclaimers.

     The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and
     multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single
     copy.  If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name
     but different contents, make the title of each such section unique
     by adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the
     original author or publisher of that section if known, or else a
     unique number.  Make the same adjustment to the section titles in
     the list of Invariant Sections in the license notice of the
     combined work.

     In the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled
     "History" in the various original documents, forming one section
     Entitled "History"; likewise combine any sections Entitled
     "Acknowledgements", and any sections Entitled "Dedications".  You
     must delete all sections Entitled "Endorsements."

  6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS

     You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other
     documents released under this License, and replace the individual
     copies of this License in the various documents with a single copy
     that is included in the collection, provided that you follow the
     rules of this License for verbatim copying of each of the
     documents in all other respects.

     You may extract a single document from such a collection, and
     distribute it individually under this License, provided you insert
     a copy of this License into the extracted document, and follow
     this License in all other respects regarding verbatim copying of
     that document.

  7. AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS

     A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other
     separate and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of
     a storage or distribution medium, is called an "aggregate" if the
     copyright resulting from the compilation is not used to limit the
     legal rights of the compilation's users beyond what the individual
     works permit.  When the Document is included an aggregate, this
     License does not apply to the other works in the aggregate which
     are not themselves derivative works of the Document.

     If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these
     copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one half
     of the entire aggregate, the Document's Cover Texts may be placed
     on covers that bracket the Document within the aggregate, or the
     electronic equivalent of covers if the Document is in electronic
     form.  Otherwise they must appear on printed covers that bracket
     the whole aggregate.

  8. TRANSLATION

     Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may
     distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section
     4.  Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special
     permission from their copyright holders, but you may include
     translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the
     original versions of these Invariant Sections.  You may include a
     translation of this License, and all the license notices in the
     Document, and any Warrany Disclaimers, provided that you also
     include the original English version of this License and the
     original versions of those notices and disclaimers.  In case of a
     disagreement between the translation and the original version of
     this License or a notice or disclaimer, the original version will
     prevail.

     If a section in the Document is Entitled "Acknowledgements",
     "Dedications", or "History", the requirement (section 4) to
     Preserve its Title (section 1) will typically require changing the
     actual title.

  9. TERMINATION

     You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document
     except as expressly provided for under this License.  Any other
     attempt to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Document is
     void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this
     License.  However, parties who have received copies, or rights,
     from you under this License will not have their licenses
     terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.

 10. FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE

     The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions of
     the GNU Free Documentation License from time to time.  Such new
     versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
     differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.  See
     `http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/'.

     Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version
     number.  If the Document specifies that a particular numbered
     version of this License "or any later version" applies to it, you
     have the option of following the terms and conditions either of
     that specified version or of any later version that has been
     published (not as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation.  If
     the Document does not specify a version number of this License,
     you may choose any version ever published (not as a draft) by the
     Free Software Foundation.

ADDENDUM: How to use this License for your documents
----------------------------------------------------

To use this License in a document you have written, include a copy of
the License in the document and put the following copyright and license
notices just after the title page:

       Copyright (C)  YEAR  YOUR NAME.
       Permission is granted to copy, distribute and/or modify this document
       under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.2
       or any later version published by the Free Software Foundation;
       with no Invariant Sections, no Front-Cover Texts, and no Back-Cover Texts.
       A copy of the license is included in the section entitled ``GNU
       Free Documentation License''.

   If you have Invariant Sections, Front-Cover Texts and Back-Cover
Texts, replace the "with...Texts." line with this:

         with the Invariant Sections being LIST THEIR TITLES, with
         the Front-Cover Texts being LIST, and with the Back-Cover Texts
         being LIST.

   If you have Invariant Sections without Cover Texts, or some other
combination of the three, merge those two alternatives to suit the
situation.

   If your document contains nontrivial examples of program code, we
recommend releasing these examples in parallel under your choice of
free software license, such as the GNU General Public License, to
permit their use in free software.

GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
==========================

                         Version 2, June 1991

     Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
     59 Temple Place - Suite 330, Boston, MA  02111-1307, USA
     
     Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
     of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

Preamble
--------

The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom
to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public License is
intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free
software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This
General Public License applies to most of the Free Software
Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to
using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by
the GNU Library General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to
your programs, too.

   When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it
if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in
new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.

   To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.
These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.

   For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that
you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the
source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their
rights.

   We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software,
and (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
distribute and/or modify the software.

   Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain
that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
authors' reputations.

   Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free
program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the
program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any
patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.

   The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.

    TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
  0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains a
     notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed
     under the terms of this General Public License.  The "Program",
     below, refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on
     the Program" means either the Program or any derivative work under
     copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Program or a
     portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or
     translated into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is
     included without limitation in the term "modification".)  Each
     licensee is addressed as "you".

     Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are
     not covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act
     of running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the
     Program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on
     the Program (independent of having been made by running the
     Program).  Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.

  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's
     source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you
     conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate
     copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the
     notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any
     warranty; and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of
     this License along with the Program.

     You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,
     and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange
     for a fee.

  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion
     of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and
     distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
     above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

       a. You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.

       b. You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that
          in whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program
          or any part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge
          to all third parties under the terms of this License.

       c. If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
          when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
          interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display
          an announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and
          a notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you
          provide a warranty) and that users may redistribute the
          program under these conditions, and telling the user how to
          view a copy of this License.  (Exception: if the Program
          itself is interactive but does not normally print such an
          announcement, your work based on the Program is not required
          to print an announcement.)

     These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
     identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the
     Program, and can be reasonably considered independent and separate
     works in themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not
     apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate
     works.  But when you distribute the same sections as part of a
     whole which is a work based on the Program, the distribution of
     the whole must be on the terms of this License, whose permissions
     for other licensees extend to the entire whole, and thus to each
     and every part regardless of who wrote it.

     Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or
     contest your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the
     intent is to exercise the right to control the distribution of
     derivative or collective works based on the Program.

     In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the
     Program with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on
     a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring the
     other work under the scope of this License.

  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
     under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms
     of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the
     following:

       a. Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
          source code, which must be distributed under the terms of
          Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for
          software interchange; or,

       b. Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
          years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your
          cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete
          machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
          distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a
          medium customarily used for software interchange; or,

       c. Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer
          to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is
          allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you
          received the program in object code or executable form with
          such an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)

     The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
     making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete
     source code means all the source code for all modules it contains,
     plus any associated interface definition files, plus the scripts
     used to control compilation and installation of the executable.
     However, as a special exception, the source code distributed need
     not include anything that is normally distributed (in either
     source or binary form) with the major components (compiler,
     kernel, and so on) of the operating system on which the executable
     runs, unless that component itself accompanies the executable.

     If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering
     access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent
     access to copy the source code from the same place counts as
     distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not
     compelled to copy the source along with the object code.

  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
     except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
     otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is
     void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this
     License.  However, parties who have received copies, or rights,
     from you under this License will not have their licenses
     terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.

  5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
     signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify
     or distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions
     are prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.
     Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Program (or any work
     based on the Program), you indicate your acceptance of this
     License to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying,
     distributing or modifying the Program or works based on it.

  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
     Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
     original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program
     subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any
     further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights
     granted herein.  You are not responsible for enforcing compliance
     by third parties to this License.

  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
     infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent
     issues), conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order,
     agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this
     License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this
     License.  If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously
     your obligations under this License and any other pertinent
     obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the
     Program at all.  For example, if a patent license would not permit
     royalty-free redistribution of the Program by all those who
     receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only
     way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain
     entirely from distribution of the Program.

     If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable
     under any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is
     intended to apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply
     in other circumstances.

     It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
     patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of
     any such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting
     the integrity of the free software distribution system, which is
     implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
     generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
     through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
     system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is
     willing to distribute software through any other system and a
     licensee cannot impose that choice.

     This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed
     to be a consequence of the rest of this License.

  8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
     certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces,
     the original copyright holder who places the Program under this
     License may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation
     excluding those countries, so that distribution is permitted only
     in or among countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this
     License incorporates the limitation as if written in the body of
     this License.

  9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
     versions of the General Public License from time to time.  Such
     new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but
     may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.

     Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the
     Program specifies a version number of this License which applies
     to it and "any later version", you have the option of following
     the terms and conditions either of that version or of any later
     version published by the Free Software Foundation.  If the Program
     does not specify a version number of this License, you may choose
     any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.

 10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
     programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the
     author to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted
     by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software
     Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our decision
     will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status of

 11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO
     WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE
     LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT

Appendix: How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs
-------------------------------------------------------

If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these
terms.

   To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest
to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

     ONE LINE TO GIVE THE PROGRAM'S NAME AND A BRIEF IDEA OF WHAT IT DOES.
     Copyright (C) YYYY  NAME OF AUTHOR
     
     This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify
     it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
     the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or
     (at your option) any later version.
     
     This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
     but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
     MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the
     GNU General Public License for more details.
     
     You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
     along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software
     Foundation, Inc., 59 Temple Place - Suite 330, Boston, MA  02111-1307, USA.

   Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper
mail.

   If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like
this when it starts in an interactive mode:

     Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) 19YY NAME OF AUTHOR
     Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.
     This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it
     under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.

   The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the
appropriate parts of the General Public License.  Of course, the
commands you use may be called something other than `show w' and `show
c'; they could even be mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your
program.

   You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or
your school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program,
if necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:

     Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program
     `Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker.
     
     SIGNATURE OF TY COON, 1 April 1989
     Ty Coon, President of Vice

   This General Public License does not permit incorporating your
program into proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine
library, you may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary
applications with the library.  If this is what you want to do, use the
GNU Library General Public License instead of this License.
