FreeSDP - A Free SDP Parser and Formatter
 
	FreeSDP is a stand-alone free library written in C that
provides a complete set of functions to parse and fetch the
information multimedia session descriptions formatted in SDP
enclose. It can also format SDP descriptions from the session
parameters. SDP is the Session Description Protocol from the IETF (see
RFC 2327 and draft-ietf-mmusic-sdp-new.

	FreeSDP has been designed with minimality, security and speed
in mind. Its only dependency is a standard C library. In addition, it
is thread-safe. Any contribution, comments or suggestions related to
FreeSDP can be addressed to fedemp@altern.org.

	The FreeSDP manual (written in GNU Texinfo format) is
distributed along with the library and is located in the directory
doc. There is also a complete reference manual generated by doxygen in
both HTML and LaTeX format under the directory doc/refman.

	There are a few demo applications under the demo
directory. These are also build when you build the library and are a
good starting point to both testing and learning to use FreeSDP. Of
course, they will not be installed on the system when you type make
install.

	This package can be installed with the three usual commands:

	$ ./configure
	$ make
	$ make install

	(see the file INSTALL for general instructions).
